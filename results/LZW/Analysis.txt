1. LZW (dynamic dictioanary technique)- 

(The given below are the test results for only text-files)

  Filesize        Compressed Size      Compression Time     Decompression Time

  511.2kb            260.4kb              0.396                 0.245 
  1.02MB             0.50MB               0.701                 0.323  
  2.5MB              1.20MB               1.433                 0.900

Important points to note are - 

1. Average Compression ratio achived around 2.1 for all text files compressed. 

2. High compression is achieved for files have many repeating characters. 

3. Provides better results on large text files.

4. Only text files are compressed and bianry files given are actaully
overcompressed. (NULL character problem in the code)

5. Due to Dynamic dictionary there is a problem while decompression certain
specific files. The problem to due to updating the dictionary and current bit
lenght.
