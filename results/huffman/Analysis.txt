1. Canonical huffman compression -

(The given below are the test results for only text-files)

  Filesize        Compressed Size      Compression Time     Decompression Time
  (.txt)              (.kp)              (in sec)               (in sec)
   
  5kb                3.1kb                0.012                 0.007
  55kb               37.3kb               0.077                 0.040
  109.5kb            67.2kb               0.093                 0.053

  2.5MB              1.27MB               2.433                 1.900

Important points to note are - 

1. Average Compression ratio achived is 1.56 for all text files compressed. 
2. High compression is achieved for files have many repeating characters. 
3. Provides better results on large text files.

Failures -

1. Only text files are compressed and bianry files given are actaully
overcompressed. And thus the code is applicable for text files only.

2. The tree maintaing for decoder is a tedious work.
